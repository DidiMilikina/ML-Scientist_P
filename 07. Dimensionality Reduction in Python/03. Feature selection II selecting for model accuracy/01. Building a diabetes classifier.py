Building a diabetes classifier
You'll be using the Pima Indians diabetes dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes using logistic regression. There are 8 features and one target in this dataset. The data has been split into a training and test set and pre-loaded for you as X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test.

A StandardScaler() instance has been predefined as scaler and a LogisticRegression() one as lr.

Instructions
100 XP
Fit the scaler on the training features and transform these features in one go.
Fit the logistic regression model on the scaled training data.
Scale the test features.
Predict diabetes presence on the scaled test set.
'''
SOLUTION
# Fit the scaler on the training features and transform these in one go
X_train_std = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)

# Fit the logistic regression model on the scaled training data
lr.fit(X_train_std, y_train)

# Scale the test features
X_test_std = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Predict diabetes presence on the scaled test set
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test_std)

# Prints accuracy metrics and feature coefficients
print("{0:.1%} accuracy on test set.".format(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))) 
print(dict(zip(X.columns, abs(lr.coef_[0]).round(2))))
