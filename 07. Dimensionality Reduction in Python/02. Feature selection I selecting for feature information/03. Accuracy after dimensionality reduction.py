Accuracy after dimensionality reduction
You'll reduce the overfit with the help of dimensionality reduction. In this case, you'll apply a rather drastic form of dimensionality reduction by only selecting a single column that has some good information to distinguish between genders. You'll repeat the train-test split, model fit and prediction steps to compare the accuracy on test vs. training data.

All relevant packages and y have been pre-loaded.

Instructions
100 XP
Select just the neck circumference ('neckcircumferencebase') column from ansur_df.
Split the data, instantiate a classifier and fit the data. This has been done for you.
Once again calculate the accuracy scores on both training and test set.

SOLUTION
# Assign just the 'neckcircumferencebase' column from ansur_df to X
X = ansur_df[['neckcircumferencebase']]

# Split the data, instantiate a classifier and fit the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3)
svc = SVC()
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate accuracy scores on both train and test data
accuracy_train = accuracy_score(y_train, svc.predict(X_train))
accuracy_test = accuracy_score(y_test, svc.predict(X_test))

print("{0:.1%} accuracy on test set vs. {1:.1%} on training set".format(accuracy_test, accuracy_train))
