Make a model and compile it
Now that you've input and output layers for the 3-input model, wrap them up in a Keras model class, and then compile the model, so you can fit it to data and use it to make predictions on new data.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a model using team_in_1, team_in_2, and home_in as inputs and out as the output.
Compile the model using the 'adam' optimizer and 'mean_absolute_error' as the loss function.
