'''
Running LogisticRegression and SVC
In this exercise, you'll apply logistic regression and a support vector machine to classify images of handwritten digits.

Instructions
100 XP
Apply logistic regression and SVM (using SVC()) to the handwritten digits data set using the provided train/validation split.
For each classifier, print out the training and validation accuracy.
'''
SOLUTION
from sklearn import datasets

digits = datasets.load_digits()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target)

# Apply logistic regression and print scores
lr = LogisticRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(lr.score(X_train, y_train))
print(lr.score(X_test, y_test))

# Apply SVM and print scores
svm = SVC()
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(svm.score(X_train, y_train))
print(svm.score(X_test, y_test))
