Mean target encoding
First of all, you will create a function that implements mean target encoding. Remember that you need to develop the two following steps:

Calculate the mean on the train, apply to the test
Split train into K folds. Calculate the out-of-fold mean for each fold, apply to this particular fold
Each of these steps will be implemented in a separate function: test_mean_target_encoding() and train_mean_target_encoding(), respectively.

The final function mean_target_encoding() takes as arguments: the train and test DataFrames, the name of the categorical column to be encoded, the name of the target column and a smoothing parameter alpha. It returns two values: a new feature for train and test DataFrames, respectively.

1
You need to add smoothing to avoid overfitting. So, add Î± parameter to the denominator in train_statistics calculations.
You need to treat new categories in the test data. So, pass a global mean as an argument to the fillna() method.

2
To calculate the train mean encoded feature you need to use out-of-fold statistics, splitting train into several folds. Specify the train and test indices for each validation split to access it.

3
Finally, you just calculate train and test target mean encoded features and return them from the function. So, return train_feature and test_feature obtained.
