Trying other methods
As we saw in the video, not being sure about what thresholding method to use isn't a problem. In fact, scikit-image provides us with a function to check multiple methods and see for ourselves what the best option is. It returns a figure comparing the outputs of different global thresholding methods.

Forest fruits
Image loaded as fruits_image.
You will apply this function to this image, matplotlib.pyplot has been loaded as plt. Remember that you can use try_all_threshold() to try multiple global algorithms.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the try all function.
Import the rgb to gray convertor function.
Turn the fruits image to grayscale.
Use the try all method on the grayscale image.

SOLUTION

# Import the try all function
from skimage.filters import try_all_threshold

# Import the rgb to gray convertor function 
from skimage.color import rgb2gray
    
# Turn the fruits image to grayscale
grayscale = rgb2gray(fruits_image)

# Use the try all method on the grayscale image
fig, ax = try_all_threshold(grayscale, verbose=False)

# Show the resulting plots
plt.show()
