Superpixel segmentation
In this exercise, you will apply unsupervised segmentation to the same image, before it's passed to a face detection machine learning model.

So you will reduce this image from 265Ã—191=50,615 pixels down to 400 regions.

Already preloaded as face_image.
The show_image() function has been preloaded for you as well.

Instructions
100 XP

Import the slic() function from the segmentation module.
Import the label2rgb() function from the color module.
Obtain the segmentation with 400 regions using slic().
Put segments on top of original image to compare with label2rgb().

SOLUTION

# Import the slic function from segmentation module
from skimage.segmentation import slic

# Import the label2rgb function from color module
from skimage.color import label2rgb

# Obtain the segmentation with 400 regions
segments = slic(face_image, n_segments=400)

# Put segments on top of original image to compare
segmented_image = label2rgb(segments, face_image, kind='avg')

# Show the segmented image
show_image(segmented_image, "Segmented image, 400 superpixels")
