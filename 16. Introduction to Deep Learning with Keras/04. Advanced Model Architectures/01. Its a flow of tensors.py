It's a flow of tensors
If you have already built a model, you can use the model.layers and the keras.backend to build functions that, provided with a valid input tensor, return the corresponding output tensor.

This is a useful tool when trying to understand what is going on inside the layers of a neural network.

For instance, if you get the input and output from the first layer of a network, you can build an inp_to_out function that returns the result of carrying out forward propagation through only the first layer for a given input tensor.

So that's what you're going to do right now!

X_test from the Banknote Authentication dataset and its model are preloaded. Type model.summary() in the console to check it.

Instructions
100 XP
Import keras.backend as K.
Use model.layers to get the input and output of the first layer.
Use K.function() to define a function that maps inp to out.
Print the results of passing X_test through the 1st layer.

SOLUTION

# Import keras backend
import keras.backend as K

# Input tensor from the 1st layer of the model
inp = model.layers[0].input

# Output tensor from the 1st layer of the model
out = model.layers[0].output

# Define a function from inputs to outputs
inp_to_out = K.function([inp], [out])

# Print the results of passing X_test through the 1st layer
print(inp_to_out([X_test]))
