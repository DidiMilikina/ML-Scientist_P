Learning the digits
You're going to build a model on the digits dataset, a sample dataset that comes pre-loaded with scikit learn. The digits dataset consist of 8x8 pixel handwritten digits from 0 to 9:


You want to distinguish between each of the 10 possible digits given an image, so we are dealing with multi-class classification.
The dataset has already been partitioned into X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test using 30% of the data as testing data. The labels are one-hot encoded vectors, so you don't need to use Keras to_categorical() function.

Let's build this new model!

Instructions
100 XP
Add a Dense layer of 16 neurons with relu activation and input_shape being the total number of pixels of each image.
Add a Dense layer with 10 outputs and softmax activation.
Compile your model with adam, categorical_crossentropy, and accuracy metrics.
Make sure your model works by predicting on X_train.

SOLUTION

# Instantiate a Sequential model
model = Sequential()

# Input and hidden layer with input_shape, 16 neurons, and relu 
model.add(Dense(16, input_shape = (64,), activation = 'relu'))

# Output layer with 10 neurons (one per digit) and softmax
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile your model
model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Test if your model works and can process input data
print(model.predict(X_train))
