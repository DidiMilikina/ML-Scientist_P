Training with multiple labels
An output of your multi-label model could look like this: [0.76 , 0.99 , 0.66 ]. If we round up probabilities higher than 0.5, this observation will be classified as containing all 3 possible labels [1,1,1]. For this particular problem, this would mean watering all 3 parcels in your field is the right thing to do given the input sensor measurements.

You will now train and predict with the model you just built. sensors_train, parcels_train, sensors_test and parcels_test are already loaded for you to use. Let's see how well your machine performs!

Instructions
100 XP
Train the model for 100 epochs using a validation_split of 0.2.
Predict with your model using the test data.
Round up your preds with np.round().
Evaluate your model's accuracy on the test data.

SOLUTION

# Train for 100 epochs using a validation split of 0.2
model.fit(sensors_train, parcels_train, epochs = 100, validation_split = 0.2)

# Predict on sensors_test and round up the predictions
preds = model.predict(sensors_test)
preds_rounded = np.round(preds)

# Print rounded preds
print('Rounded Predictions: \n', preds_rounded)

# Evaluate your model's accuracy on the test data
accuracy = model.evaluate(sensors_test, parcels_test)[1]

# Print accuracy
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
