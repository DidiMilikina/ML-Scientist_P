Training on dart throwers
Your model is now ready, just as your dataset. It's time to train!

The coordinates and competitors variables you just transformed have been partitioned into coord_train,competitors_train, coord_test and competitors_test. Your model is also loaded. Feel free to visualize your training data or model.summary() in the console.

Instructions
100 XP
Train your model on the training data for 200 epochs.
Evaluate your model accuracy on the test data.

SOLUTION

# Train your model on the training data for 200 epochs
model.fit(coord_train,competitors_train,epochs=200)

# Evaluate your model accuracy on the test data
accuracy = model.evaluate(coord_test, competitors_test)[1]

# Print accuracy
print('Accuracy:', accuracy)
