'''
Early stopping your model
The early stopping callback is useful since it allows for you to stop the model training if it no longer improves after a given number of epochs. To make use of this functionality you need to pass the callback inside a list to the model's callback parameter in the .fit() method.

The model you built to detect fake dollar bills is loaded for you to train, this time with early stopping. X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test are also available for you to use.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the EarlyStoppingcallback from keras.callbacks.
Define a callback, monitor 'val_acc' with a patience of 5 epochs.
Train your model using the early stopping callback.

SOLUTION

# Import the early stopping callback
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

# Define a callback to monitor val_acc
monitor_val_acc = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_acc', 
                       patience=5)

# Train your model using the early stopping callback
model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
           epochs=1000, validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
           callbacks=[monitor_val_acc])
