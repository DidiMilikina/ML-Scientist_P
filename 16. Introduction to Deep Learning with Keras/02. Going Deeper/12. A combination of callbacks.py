'''
A combination of callbacks
Deep learning models can take a long time to train, especially when you move to deeper architectures and bigger datasets. Saving your model every time it improves as well as stopping it when it no longer does allows you to worry less about choosing the number of epochs to train for. You can also restore a saved model anytime.

The model training and validation data are available in your workspace as X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.

Use the EarlyStopping() and the ModelCheckpoint() callbacks so that you can go eat a jar of cookies while you leave your computer to work!

Instructions
100 XP
Import both the EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks from keras.
Create monitor_val_acc as an EarlyStopping callback that will monitor 'val_acc', with a patience of 3 epochs.
Create modelCheckpoint as a ModelCheckpointcallback, save the best model as best_banknote_model.hdf5.
Fit your model providing a list with the defined callbacks and X_test and y_test as validation data.

SOLUTION

# Import the EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint callbacks
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint

# Early stop on validation accuracy
monitor_val_acc = EarlyStopping(monitor = 'val_acc', patience=3)

# Save the best model as best_banknote_model.hdf5
modelCheckpoint = ModelCheckpoint('best_banknote_model.hdf5', save_best_only = True)

# Fit your model for a stupid amount of epochs
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train,
                    epochs = 10000000,
                    callbacks = [monitor_val_acc, modelCheckpoint],
                    validation_data = (X_test, y_test))
