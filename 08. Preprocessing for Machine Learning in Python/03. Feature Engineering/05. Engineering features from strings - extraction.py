Engineering features from strings - extraction
The Length column in the hiking dataset is a column of strings, but contained in the column is the mileage for the hike. We're going to extract this mileage using regular expressions, and then use a lambda in Pandas to apply the extraction to the DataFrame.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a pattern that will extract numbers and decimals from text, using \d+ to get numbers and \. to get decimals, and pass it into re's compile function.
Use re's match function to search the text, passing in the pattern and the length text.
Use the matched mile's group() attribute to extract the matched pattern, making sure to match group 0, and pass it into float.
Apply the return_mileage() function to the hiking["Length"] column.

SOLUTION
# Write a pattern to extract numbers and decimals
def return_mileage(length):
    pattern = re.compile(r"\d+\.\d+")
    
    # Search the text for matches
    mile = re.match(pattern, length)
    
    # If a value is returned, use group(0) to return the found value
    if mile is not None:
        return float(mile.group(0))
        
# Apply the function to the Length column and take a look at both columns
hiking["Length_num"] = hiking["Length"].apply(lambda row: return_mileage(row))
print(hiking[["Length", "Length_num"]].head())
