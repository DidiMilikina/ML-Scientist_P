Using PCA
Let's apply PCA to the wine dataset, to see if we can get an increase in our model's accuracy.

Instructions
100 XP
Set up the PCA object. You'll use PCA on the wine dataset minus its label for Type, stored in the variable wine_X.
Apply PCA to wine_X using pca's fit_transform method and store the transformed vector in transformed_X.
Print out the explained_variance_ratio_ attribute of pca to check how much variance is explained by each component.
'''
SOLUTION
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Set up PCA and the X vector for diminsionality reduction
pca = PCA()
wine_X = wine.drop("Type", axis=1)

# Apply PCA to the wine dataset X vector
transformed_X = pca.fit_transform(wine_X)

# Look at the percentage of variance explained by the different components
print(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)
