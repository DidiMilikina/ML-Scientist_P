KNN on non-scaled data
Let's first take a look at the accuracy of a K-nearest neighbors model on the wine dataset without standardizing the data. The knn model as well as the X and y data and labels sets have been created already. Most of this process of creating models in scikit-learn should look familiar to you.

Instructions
100 XP
Split the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split().
Use the knn model's fit() method on the X_train data and y_train labels, to fit the model to the data.
Print out the knn model's score() on the X_test data and y_test labels to evaluate the model.

SOLUTION
# Split the dataset and labels into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Fit the k-nearest neighbors model to the training data
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Score the model on the test data
print(knn.score(X_test, y_test))
