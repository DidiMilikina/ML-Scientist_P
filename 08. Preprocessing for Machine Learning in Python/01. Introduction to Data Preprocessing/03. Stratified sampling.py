Stratified sampling
We know that the distribution of variables in the category_desc column in the volunteer dataset is uneven. If we wanted to train a model to try to predict category_desc, we would want to train the model on a sample of data that is representative of the entire dataset. Stratified sampling is a way to achieve this.

Instructions
100 XP
Create a volunteer_X dataset with all of the columns except category_desc.
Create a volunteer_y training labels dataset.
Split up the volunteer_X dataset using scikit-learn's train_test_split function and passing volunteer_y into the stratify= parameter.
Take a look at the category_desc value counts on the training labels.

SOLUTION
# Create a data with all columns except category_desc
volunteer_X = volunteer.drop("category_desc", axis=1)

# Create a category_desc labels dataset
volunteer_y = volunteer[["category_desc"]]

# Use stratified sampling to split up the dataset according to the volunteer_y dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(volunteer_X, volunteer_y, stratify=volunteer_y)

# Print out the category_desc counts on the training y labels
print(y_train["category_desc"].value_counts())
