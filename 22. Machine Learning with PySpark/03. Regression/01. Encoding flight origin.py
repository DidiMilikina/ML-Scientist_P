Encoding flight origin
The org column in the flights data is a categorical variable giving the airport from which a flight departs.

ORD — O'Hare International Airport (Chicago)
SFO — San Francisco International Airport
JFK — John F Kennedy International Airport (New York)
LGA — La Guardia Airport (New York)
SMF — Sacramento
SJC — San Jose
TUS — Tucson International Airport
OGG — Kahului (Hawaii)
Obviously this is only a small subset of airports. Nevertheless, since this is a categorical variable, it needs to be one-hot encoded before it can be used in a regression model.

The data are in a variable called flights. You have already used a string indexer to create a column of indexed values corresponding to the strings in org.

Note:: You might find it useful to revise the slides from the lessons in the Slides panel next to the IPython Shell.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the one-hot encoder class.
Create an one-hot encoder instance, naming the output column 'org_dummy'.
Apply the one-hot encoder to the flights data.
Generate a summary of the mapping from categorical values to binary encoded dummy variables. Include only unique values and order by org_idx.

SOLUTION

# Import the one hot encoder class
from pyspark.ml.feature import OneHotEncoderEstimator

# Create an instance of the one hot encoder
onehot = OneHotEncoderEstimator(inputCols=['org_idx'], outputCols=['org_dummy'])

# Apply the one hot encoder to the flights data
onehot = onehot.fit(flights)
flights_onehot = onehot.transform(flights)

# Check the results
flights_onehot.select('org', 'org_idx', 'org_dummy').distinct().sort('org_idx').show()
