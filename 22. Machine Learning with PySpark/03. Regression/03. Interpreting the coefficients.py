Interpreting the coefficients
The linear regression model for flight duration as a function of distance takes the form

duration=α+β×distance
where

α — intercept (component of duration which does not depend on distance) and
β — coefficient (rate at which duration increases as a function of distance; also called the slope).
By looking at the coefficients of your model you will be able to infer

how much of the average flight duration is actually spent on the ground and
what the average speed is during a flight.
The linear regression model is available as regression.

What's the intercept?
What are the coefficients? This is a vector.
Extract the element from the vector which corresponds to the slope for distance.
Find the average speed in km per hour.

# Intercept (average minutes on ground)
inter = regression.intercept
print(inter)

# Coefficients
coefs = regression.coefficients
print(coefs)

# Average minutes per km
minutes_per_km = regression.coefficients[0]
print(minutes_per_km)

# Average speed in km per hour
avg_speed = 60 / minutes_per_km
