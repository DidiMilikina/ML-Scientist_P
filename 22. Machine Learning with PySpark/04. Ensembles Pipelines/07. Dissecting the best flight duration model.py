Dissecting the best flight duration model
You just set up a CrossValidator to find good parameters for the linear regression model predicting flight duration.

Now you're going to take a closer look at the resulting model, split out the stages and use it to make predictions on the testing data.

The following have already been created:

cv — a trained CrossValidatorModel object and
evaluator — a RegressionEvaluator object.
The flights data have been randomly split into flights_train and flights_test.

Instructions
100 XP
Retrieve the best model.
Look at the stages in the best model.
Isolate the linear regression stage and extract its parameters.
Use the best model to generate predictions on the testing data and calculate the RMSE.

SOLUTION

# Get the best model from cross validation
best_model = cv.bestModel

# Look at the stages in the best model
print(best_model.stages)

# Get the parameters for the LinearRegression object in the best model
best_model.stages[3].extractParamMap()

# Generate predictions on testing data using the best model then calculate RMSE
predictions = best_model.transform(flights_test)
evaluator.evaluate(predictions)
