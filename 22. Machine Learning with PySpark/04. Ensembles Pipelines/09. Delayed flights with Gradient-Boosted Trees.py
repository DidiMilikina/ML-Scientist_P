Delayed flights with Gradient-Boosted Trees
You've previously built a classifier for flights likely to be delayed using a Decision Tree. In this exercise you'll compare a Decision Tree model to a Gradient-Boosted Trees model.

The flights data have been randomly split into flights_train and flights_test.

Instructions
100 XP
Import the classes required to create Decision Tree and Gradient-Boosted Tree classifiers.
Create Decision Tree and Gradient-Boosted Tree classifiers. Train on the training data.
Create an evaluator and calculate AUC on testing data for both classifiers. Which model performs better?
Find the number of trees and the relative importance of features in the Gradient-Boosted Tree classifier.

SOLUTION

# Import the classes required
from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier, GBTClassifier
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import BinaryClassificationEvaluator

# Create model objects and train on training data
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier().fit(flights_train)
gbt = GBTClassifier().fit(flights_train)

# Compare AUC on testing data
evaluator = BinaryClassificationEvaluator()
evaluator.evaluate(tree.transform(flights_test))
evaluator.evaluate(gbt.transform(flights_test))

# Find the number of trees and the relative importance of features
print(gbt.trees)
print(gbt.featureImportances)
