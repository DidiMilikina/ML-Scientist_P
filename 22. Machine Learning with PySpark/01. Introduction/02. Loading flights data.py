Loading flights data
In this exercise you're going to load some airline flight data from a CSV file. To ensure that the exercise runs quickly these data have been trimmed down to only 50 000 records. You can get a larger dataset in the same format here.

Notes on CSV format:

fields are separated by a comma (this is the default separator) and
missing data are denoted by the string 'NA'.
Data dictionary:

mon — month (integer between 1 and 12)
dom — day of month (integer between 1 and 31)
dow — day of week (integer; 1 = Monday and 7 = Sunday)
org — origin airport (IATA code)
mile — distance (miles)
carrier — carrier (IATA code)
depart — departure time (decimal hour)
duration — expected duration (minutes)
delay — delay (minutes)
pyspark has been imported for you and the session has been initialized.

Note: The data have been aggressively down-sampled.

SOLUTION

# Read data from CSV file
flights = spark.read.csv('flights.csv',
                         sep=',',
                         header=True,
                         inferSchema=True,
                         nullValue='NA')

# Get number of records
print("The data contain %d records." % flights.count())

# View the first five records
flights.show(5)

# Check column data types
flights.dtypes
