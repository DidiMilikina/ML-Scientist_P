Column manipulation
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) considers a flight to be "delayed" when it arrives 15 minutes or more after its scheduled time.

The next step of preparing the flight data has two parts:

convert the units of distance, replacing the mile column with a kmcolumn; and
create a Boolean column indicating whether or not a flight was delayed.
Instructions
100 XP
Import a function which will allow you to round a number to a specific number of decimal places.
Derive a new km column from the mile column, rounding to zero decimal places. One mile is 1,60934 km.
Remove the mile column.
Create a label column with a value of 1 indicating the delay was 15 minutes or more and 0 otherwise.

SOLUTION

# Import the required function
from pyspark.sql.functions import round

# Convert 'mile' to 'km' and drop 'mile' column
flights_km = flights.withColumn('km', round(flights.mile * 1.60934 , 0)) \
                    .drop('mile')

# Create 'label' column indicating whether flight delayed (1) or not (0)
flights_km = flights_km.withColumn('label', (flights_km.delay >= 15).cast('integer'))

# Check first five records
flights_km.show(5)
