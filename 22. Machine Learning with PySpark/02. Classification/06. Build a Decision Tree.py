Build a Decision Tree
Now that you've split the flights data into training and testing sets, you can use the training set to fit a Decision Tree model.

The data are available as flights_train and flights_test.

NOTE: It will take a few seconds for the model to train... please be patient!

Instructions
100 XP
Import the class for creating a Decision Tree classifier.
Create a classifier object and fit it to the training data.
Make predictions for the testing data and take a look at the predictions.

SOLUTION

# Import the Decision Tree Classifier class
from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Create a classifier object and fit to the training data
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
tree_model = tree.fit(flights_train)

# Create predictions for the testing data and take a look at the predictions
prediction = tree_model.transform(flights_test)
prediction.select('label', 'prediction', 'probability').show(5, False)
